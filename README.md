# Capstone

The goal of my capstone was to determine personality traits based on the language in blog posts. Using a Kaggle dataset, I was able to pull text from individual posters and then use their self-defined personality type to connect language use with different personality traits. This is based off of the Myers-Briggs personality type. The workbooks follow the different steps of analysis I went through, from data collection and cleaning to optimizing model performance, for more detailed results please refer to my powerpoint presentation or reach out directly.
